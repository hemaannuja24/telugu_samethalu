##  AI Classification

The app uses a multilingual zero-shot classification model to predict the category of a proverb from 20 themes:
Family, Friendship, Morality, Hard Work, Knowledge, Devotion, Culture, Literature,
Humility, Patience, Courage, Arrogance, Love, Greed, Wisdom, Responsibility,
Satire, Politics, Wealth, Time


This is powered by HuggingFace’s [`pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) abstraction.
